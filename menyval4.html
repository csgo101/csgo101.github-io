 </h2>
 <p>Well before we start, I presume many out there already know how to aim but are willing to take it to the next step. Since I believe you know the basics, I will be discussing the things you need to do to further enhance your aiming. But before we start, here are some definitions that surprisingly many get wrong and as a result don’t even know how to improve them.</p>
  <p><b>Accuracy:</b> How precise you are when you move your crosshair on someone. In CS:GO accuracy can be defined as shooting the head only, nothing less!</p>

 <p><b>Reaction Time:</b> How soon you react when someone appears before you. An average reaction time of pros is less than 200 milliseconds.
 </p>

 <p><b>Reflex:</b> Muscle Memory (degree of movement that your hand remembers or moves when someone appears to you or tries to take you off-guard) OR How much your hand remembers angles when you move your mouse from one point to another and from that point to another point.</p>

 <p>Practicing on all these things together is rather difficult and will take you ages. It is best if you can practice on them separately. Consider it this way; aiming effortlessly thinking you will get better at aiming on deathmatch will get you nowhere. However, spending 15mins on each of these 3 will be like getting 500 frags because you will be stressing your muscles to get better at this.</p>

 <p>So without further delay, let’s get our aim straight.</p>
 </div>

<div id="scroll-box">
<p><h4>How to Practice:</h4></p>

 <p><b >Accuracy:</b> A good way to improve your accuracy is by playing the practice maps. Some good ones are mentioned a bit below.</p>

 <p><b>Reflex:</b> Play muscle memory maps. Try to aim on dots end to end. Try it in different angles and do it frequently. Also, another way of warming up before a match is to try muscle memory on default maps in which you are going to have a battle. For example, if you are on A short on dust2, try to move your mouse end to end from long to all the way to the short and then back again. Keep doing it on different angles.</p>

 <p><b>Reaction Time:</b> Something you will only improve with time and you have to stress yourself a lot to get better at this. A good example is getting players from Dust 2 mid double doors (open area) then trying to hit them through double door woods.</p>


 <h5>Good Aim Training Maps</h5>

 There are probably a ton of maps that you can use to improve your aim. But what are the perfect maps to do that? So why not follow the professional players in this aspect as well. Among the popular aim training maps there are some that lie above the rest as they have been preferred by a lot of pros and you can actively seem them play these on live streams as well. It’s good if you already know about them however, if this is new stuff for you then consider your past trainings in vain.
